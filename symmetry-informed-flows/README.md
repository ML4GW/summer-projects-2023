  - augment sho data that is time shifted
  - vicreg loss used to train similarity embedding
  - convolutional 2d residual net used for similarity embedding layers
  - froze similarity embedding weights, passed them for the flow training
  - posterior widths and pp plots for the flow training results


- `damped-harmonic-oscillator-without-similarity-embedding-training.ipynb`
  - Damped SHO trained the flow without the similarity embedding
