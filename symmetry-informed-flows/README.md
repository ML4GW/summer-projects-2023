# Optimizing Likelihood-free Inference using Self-supervised Neural Symmetry Embeddings

This branch of the repository contains notebooks and weights of trained models used for [ML4PS](https://ml4physicalsciences.github.io/2023/) workshop submission 69 at NeurIPS 2023. The final paper draft and the poster can be found in the [papers](https://ml4physicalsciences.github.io/2023/#papers) section of the workshop website. This work demonstrates likelihood free inference (LFI) on two signal models - a damped harmonic oscillator and a sine-gaussian pulse - whose times of arrival are marginalized using self-supervised learning.

Each directory contains the notebooks and trained weights to reproduce the figures in the paper. In particular, representations in Fig. 2 of the draft are found [here](https://github.com/ML4GW/summer-projects-2023/blob/neurips-2023/symmetry-informed-flows/notebooks/DampedHarmonicOscillator/sho-reps.ipynb) for SHO model and [here](https://github.com/ML4GW/summer-projects-2023/blob/neurips-2023/symmetry-informed-flows/notebooks/SineGaussian/sg-reps.ipynb) for SG models. Comparison posteriors between a trained flow model with similarity training vs. that without similarity pre-training and nested sampling in Fig. 3 of the draft are found [here](https://github.com/ML4GW/summer-projects-2023/blob/neurips-2023/symmetry-informed-flows/notebooks/DampedHarmonicOscillator/sho-baseline-training.ipynb) for the SHO model and [here](https://github.com/ML4GW/summer-projects-2023/blob/neurips-2023/symmetry-informed-flows/notebooks/SineGaussian/sine-gaussian-baseline-training.ipynb) for the SG model.
